# YelpCamp

YelpCamp
========

YelpCamp is a full-stack, RESTful web application project created alongside the Udemy course - [The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).


Feel free to clone the repository and use locally, however the site relies on several environment variables to access the database and use API's, so it can not be run as-is.

Features
--------
* Search for campgrounds using title, description, or author username
* User authorization/authentication using Passport.js
* Sign up for an account and optionally upload an avatar
* Create a new campground
* Edit an existing campground
* Review a campground and see the average rating of campgrounds
* View user profiles including posted campgrounds and reviews they've created
* Admin permissions that allow the editing/deletion of other users' campgrounds and reviews
